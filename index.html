            "MAY 31, 2020 Ah, this one is special. This is our first photo together (technically it is a collage but it still counts). When my mom called me a week before, saying this girl is very nice, you should at least talk to her (Before then i was not in a very marriage kind of mood. My agreeing to meet Shreya was a happy surprise for her as well). Then she messages me 8 am in the morning, & I couldn't check my phone till 11 am that day.. She would have known that I am not a morning person :). But eventually after 3 days, WE SAID YESSSSS.",
            "AUG 13, 2020 our engagement was a simple 50 person function in Corona period. Though, sitting by her side, getting sweets in my mouth by everyone (seriously, you start hating the sweet after 11th bite!) I felt as if something magical was happening. It felt like finally there is someone with whom i want to share my whole life. ",
            "SEP 03, 2020 There was s period, before and even after engagement when i was all the way on different side of the country. And the only form of communication we could do was the virtual one. We did chatting, calling, video calling on whatsapp, or sometimes on instagram (just to mix things up :) ). Bhavya (my then room mate) used to be mad sometimes that while I can talk to my fiance from the room itself, he has to go out in the lobby to get some privacy for his call ;)  Some days when it wasn't possible to call, those days felt like being in a jail with no one coming to meet me. Thankfully, that period was not long (I mean it was long, but in this diary, which will continue lifetime, it will be remembered as a small period of physical seperation which made us stronger).",
            "AUG 13, 2021 It didn't seem like it but it was almost a year and we did something to remember this day. We got a photoshoot :). We went to different places, hired a photographer, changed dressed and spent a whole morning posing for photots. In the evening also we clicked some photos (many of them were selfies) at the beach, watching the sunset, while cool breeze were flowing through her hair.. Even while writing this, I feel like i am there on Mandvi beach, sitting by my favourite person.",
            "NOV 19, 2021 Shreya's first birthday when i was in Bhuj. I had to take a big enough leave from work. So I played my best bet: I said its my fiance's birthday and she will be mad if I am not there. My bosses didnt have a choice then ;). I gifted her a cool maroon dress, in which she really looked a bomb. We got this great photo by a stranger (thank you stranger), had chinese for dinner (which was surpisingly good) and then dropped her at her home (of course i dropped her at home. what did you expect I would do!!)",
            "JAN 30, 2022 This is one of my favourite photo as a couple. This is giving me such a couple goals vibe. A cool, handsome, tall guy with beatiful, inetlligent, extraordinary girl. This was near a newly opened park on the Bhuj Mandvi highway, while it is not the most amazing place to visit, It gave us this photo.. so do visit once. And thank me later.",
            "MAR 12, 2022 This oh so amazing photograph is from our pre-wedding shoot. I didn't think i would enjoy it this much but I did. I did so much.. There were som activities like jumping in the pool, running after each other, looking deep into each other's eyes... do you know these are also the activities when you do these without camera, people will stare at you as if you are out of your mind. I guess the best fun for filming or in life comes when we give our inner child the freedom to come out once in a while. And Shreya knows about it by now, that I have given my inner child to come out any time he wants to ;)",
            "MAR 12, 2022 I always wanted to do this photo... (Correction: I always wanted to do this photo after I met Shreya :) ). Standing under an umbrella, in the rain or a snow rain (for the sake of clarification, both these were difficult in March month that too in Kachchh, hence we used a snow spray). But this photo is nothing short of the dream photo I had in mind. Another one of the best from the pre-wed shoot.",
            "MAY 10, 2022 And the day finally came. People feel great emotions while getting married. Generally I am not one of those people, who feel very much. But on my wedding day, I did. The first time when I saw her walking out on aisle, I was blushing. There were so many rituals after that.. My favourit one was when I had to fill her 'Mang' with 'Sindoor'. So this was my first time doing it, okay! Now i tried my best to only fill it in the middle, but somehow, i eneded up filling her whole forehead with it. And after that moment, all her photos have this red forehead. Which I find funny but if for the record, I am very sorry about it Shreya. But joke apart, that day, my whole life changed. I always felt a wedding is just a legal formality. But the whole process makes you feel the importance of it. It makes you feel responsible for each other's happiness. It lets you seek blessing from the almighty for the new beginnings, It lets you accept your spouce's family as your own. It is truly said that It is a union of two souls.",
            "MAY 14, 2022 Aaaaaaand we are on our honeymoon!!!!! Whoever has said Kashmir is the heaven on earth, wasn't very far off. This was the first time I have seen snow (I have seen snow in snowcone/gola but thats different). The view, the company, my beatiful phone with amazing camera.. There isn't anything I missed there. Especially not my DSLR with whome i could not have spent that much quality time with my wife :)",
            "MAY 18, 2022 In Kashmir, we went to so many places. This is from Gulmarg. The gondola ride is a must if you really want to enjoy it. There was a big line and we waited for some 1-1:30 hours. There were some annoying group who started playing antakshari in line. And yes, it is only annoying when you are not playing it. The guide we hired there clicked so many photos and videos there. He practically was our photographer that day. By this time, I had learnt how to steer a horse, and if I would have stayed there some more, I would have bought a horse for my daily commute in bhuj.",
            "OCT 04, 2022 This is also special. So a little background, Shreya loves Garba, Dandiya and the festival of Navratri. And she was worried by looking at the data that out of all the girls she knew, hardly 10% had husbands who knew how to do proper Garba. But then she did 11 Somvar Vrat to have found me as her 'Sapno ka rajkumar' who knows a little Garba. And just like that we won that Garba round with first prize in our hand.  PS. Other than we winning the 1st prize, all other things may or may not have happened the way I wrote, but I like it this way.",
            "DEC 01, 2022 It was my fried Manoj's wedding in Kharagpur. So we took a day's trip to Kolkata, enjoyed the wedding the next day, and returned back the day after that. Kolkata is nice enough city. We went to few temples, visited Victoria memorial, ahe Howrah bridge and we did it all on two wheeler. We also had to pay 'Spot fine' to a traffic police for allegedly breaking the signal. But that was the only hiccup on that day.",
            "DEC 15, 2022 So we were visiting my Dadi and Kaka-Kaki in Sangli, Maharashtra. We visited this God oh beautiful temple at Ganpatipule. And after darshan, we went to the beachside. And there was this jet ski. The adrenalin rush of the speed sweeps out everything from your mind, but there was something else on my mind as well. A fear that what if she falls down, what if I fall down. But then I saw her enjoying so much.",
            "FEB 15, 2023 Once again it was my friend Harshita's marriage and we got to go visit the pink city Jaipur. Although the wedding functions were a 2 day affair we took an extra day for visiting Jaipur. We enjoyed practicing for dance after so long (after our sangeet). While the marriage was scheduled to start midnight, it actually started early morning. After that, we also did some shopping, visited the tourists places, I got bee stuck in my hair (not once, twice!! weird right?). All in all, a comfortable and enjoyable trip. ",
            "APR 23,2023 One of the most tiring but soul nurturing experience I have ever had in my life. Siting in the Vishnu Maha Yaag, offering prayers, asking for shanti and sammruddhi and many other things.. I asked something extra. firstly strenght to sit for that long ;) but also for you to be by my side forever."
